### How to run

- start a venv `python3 -m venv venv` (assuming you have venv)
- activate it: `source venv/bin/activate` (for mac)
- install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run test (has current main): `python3 test.py`

### Note:
- There are probably errors in the strategies, and theres alot. All in strategies.py some are pretty useless however. I would get rid of them though, instead I would find a better way to store and implement different strategies. this way gets kinda messy, or just use multiple files
